- Conduct missing value imputation
- Visualize features
- Extract features
- Perform regression models

## Component specifications. 
- Name. This should be the name that you use in the component's implementation (e.g., the name of a python class or function).
- What it does. This should be a high level description of the roles of the component.
- Inputs. Be specific about the data types. For DataFrames, specify the column names and the types of the column values.
- Outputs. Same consideration as with inputs.
- How it works (ideally with pseudo code).
